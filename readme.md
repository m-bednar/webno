Deno-compatible types for browser applications.

### Disclaimer
These types may not be complete. All deprecated stuff is removed to keep things as small as possible.
There may be types that I missed, so please, feel free to post an issue or create pull request.

### Usage

```typescript
import 'https://deno.land/x/webno';

// Here you can now use document, window etc.

```
